This is an implementation of Ali Aloush's algorithm of Islamic inheritance explained at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLydybbv8P4rt9OiWJTUslroR7EzUOiVmg .

In his series A.A. offers a new approach to understanding the inheritance verses in the Holy Quran, and suggests a calculation method without the need of the Awl principle.
A.A. bases his approach solely on common sense and other Quranic verses to understand the inheritance verses.

Following is an example of the difference between A.A.'s approach and the regular Fiqh approach regarding the inheritance case involving a husband and two sisters:
